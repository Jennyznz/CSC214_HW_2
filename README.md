## Description
This project contains a List of 5 movies.
Each movie is displayed using a horizontal stack, with a poster on the left, and movie information on the right.
The movie information is itself organized using a vertical stack.
All of the above is contained within a navigation link that directs users to an image of the movie's poster when the movie item is clicked.
